I hold a degree in Graphic Design and began my career in the advertising world, where I worked in art direction for audiovisual projects. During this time, I also delved deeply into branding, which later served as a bridge to the world of product design. My transition began at a design studio collaborating with a musical instrument company specializing in synthesizers. I started designing the physical interfaces of their instruments, which sparked my passion for product design and interfaces. This led me to create landing pages for these products, where I developed an interest in how things worked beneath the surface, diving into ActionScript, HTML, and CSS. This hands-on approach transformed me into a designer capable of managing projects end-to-end—from design and planning to development.  

My journey continued as I took on consulting roles with several leading government agencies in Uruguay, including a decade-long collaboration with the National Agency for Research and Innovation (ANII). There, I played a key role in shaping the agency's product design strategy, creating a comprehensive design system, and developing key state portals that remain in use today. These projects positioned me as a pioneer in introducing product design at a state level in Uruguay.  

For over 10 years, I was also a professor in the Design and Visual Communication program at the University of the Republic in Uruguay. In this role, I mentored hundreds of students on their final projects, guiding them through the entire process—from strategic planning to final execution. This experience shaped not only my professional perspective but also my ability to lead, teach, and evaluate complex design initiatives.  

More recently, I’ve worked with ClassWallet, a U.S.-based fintech company with a focus on education. My contributions there mirrored my work with ANII, as I integrated design seamlessly into the company’s workflows, defined its visual communication strategy, and developed its branding and design systems. By building robust subsystems to support the final product, I ensured a cohesive and impactful user experience across all touchpoints.
