Trama is a digital platform designed to connect talent, entrepreneurs, researchers, business owners, and investors, facilitating collaboration to enhance research and innovation in Uruguay. In this project, my role focused on developing the design strategy, UX, UI, and overall product definition. The goal was to create an intuitive, user-friendly environment where stakeholders can easily share projects and experiences, promoting synergy and fostering growth in the national innovation ecosystem.
