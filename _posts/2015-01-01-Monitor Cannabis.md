Monitorcannabis.uy is part of the project “Towards a strategy for evaluating and monitoring cannabis regulation in Uruguay”, managed by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Uruguay (FESUR) and funded by the Open Society Foundations. The project involves collaboration with the National Drug Board, the University of the Republic, and ProDerechos. Its goal is to facilitate the exchange of relevant information on the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of cannabis regulation in Uruguay—among local stakeholders as well as regional and international actors.

Within this framework, my role in the project included:
General consulting in visual communication, identity system design, brand architecture, website design, and strategic communication.

Team: Diego Cataldo, Clara Musto, Mauricio Coitiño, ProDerechos
