<!-- Intro -->
<div class="row">
<div class="column">
As a UX/UI Consultant for ANII over a 10-year period, I contributed to the development of several digital solutions aimed at supporting Uruguay's innovation, research, and education sectors. My work involved designing user-friendly platforms.

I also helped refine the user experience for ANII’s various funding and incentive programs, ensuring they were accessible and efficient for both the public and private sectors. My focus was on making complex information and processes easy to navigate, helping to bridge the gap between innovation and real-world application.

<div class="column">
As part of a national innovation initiative, I led the development of ANII’s first internal design system and CSS framework. The goal was to create a unified, scalable solution that could be used by internal teams and external vendors to ensure consistency across all digital platforms.

The framework was designed to streamline development processes, reduce redundancies, and provide a set of reusable components that maintained accessibility and visual coherence. This system was a pioneering effort within Uruguay's public sector, providing a foundation for future digital projects while ensuring a cohesive user experience across ANII’s various services.
