Lead Product Designer, responsible for designing the native app and its design system. Gwick is a unique digital gift card platform that allows users to send personalized gift cards along with video or picture messages. Through a strategic partnership with a leading gift card manufacturer, the app offers over 250 national brands, enhancing the gifting experience on a new social media platform. My work focused on creating a seamless, intuitive experience for users, ensuring the app's design was cohesive, user-friendly, and visually engaging.
