As Lead Product Designer at SQFACTORY, I improved the platform’s ability to turn ideas into scalable systems by enhancing its user experience and design system. My work streamlined tools like UI components and logic configuration, aligning with the platform’s goal of enabling clients to build value from day one.

I also led a full rebranding effort, reinforcing SQFACTORY’s position as a fast, efficient solution for deploying custom applications and communication systems.
